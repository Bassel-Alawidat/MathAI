## 💡 What Is Computer Science?

Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It involves:

- **Algorithms** – step-by-step procedures to solve problems.
- **Data structures** – ways of organizing and storing data.
- **Software design** – how to plan and structure applications.
- **Theory of computation** – the limits of what can be computed.

It's not just about coding — it's about solving problems **logically and efficiently**.
