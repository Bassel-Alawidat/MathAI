## 🧭 What Is AI, Really?

At its core, AI is about building systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as:

- Recognizing speech or images
- Understanding language
- Making decisions
- Learning from data

It's a multidisciplinary field combining **computer science, mathematics, statistics, psychology, and neuroscience**.

## 🎓 What Should You Study?

To become an AI specialist, focus on the following areas:

### 1. **Mathematics**
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
- Probability & Statistics

### 2. **Programming**
- Python is the most widely used language in AI.
- Learn libraries like NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

### 3. **Algorithms and Data Structures**
Understanding how data is processed efficiently is key in AI systems.

### 4. **Machine Learning (ML)**
- Start with supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Move to deep learning and reinforcement learning.

### 5. **Ethics and Philosophy**
AI has great power — but also great responsibility. Understand the implications of bias, privacy, and human impact.
